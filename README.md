# AutoLink
Satisfactory QoL mod to automatically link constructed structures with existing belts/pipelines.  This prevents you from having to deconstruct belts/pipelines only to build them back exactly where they already were to get them working.  No game should ever make you do that for any reason.

When does this help?

* When you constructed and wired up a merger/splitter, but realize it was rotated incorrectly.  Instead of having to dissasemble it plus all the belts (whose contents go to your inventory) and then rebuilding everything, just rebuild the splitter/merger in the correct orientation.
* When you disassemble a building and realize it actually needs to go back, it will automatically link to the existing connections.
* Bugs! I recently encountered a bug where buildings from a blueprint were not getting power and the building power terminal said it was full even though there were no visible power lines to the buildings.  The only fix was to disassemble and reassemble the buildings - without AutoLink, this means redoing all the connections, too.

Need to investigate whether this same approach can work for newly-constructed blueprints, as it would make them tileable.
