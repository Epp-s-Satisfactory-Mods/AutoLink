# AutoLink
Satisfactory QoL mod to automatically link constructed structures with existing belts/pipelines.  This prevents you from having to deconstruct belts/pipelines only to build them back exactly where they already were to get them working.  No game should ever make you do that for any reason.

When does this help?

* When you constructed and wired up a merger/splitter, but realize it was rotated incorrectly.  Instead of having to dissasemble it plus all the belts (whose contents go to your inventory) and then rebuilding everything, just rebuild the splitter/merger in the correct orientation.
* When you disassemble a building and realize it actually needs to go back, it will automatically link to the existing connections.

Need to investigate whether this same approach works for newly-constructed blueprints, as it would make the tileable.
